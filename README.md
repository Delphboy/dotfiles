A collection of installation scripts and other things for making moving between computers that little bit easier

## Software I use
 - Firefox
 - Spotify
 - Git
 - VSCode
 - CMDer (Windows only)

## Windows
The Windows installation script is based off the [Chocolatey Package Manager](https://chocolatey.org/). Run `choco-install` in an admin CMD and then run `windows.bat` as admin.
